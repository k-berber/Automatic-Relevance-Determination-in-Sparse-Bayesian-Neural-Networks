# Automatic-Relevance-Determination-in-Sparse-Bayesian-Neural-Networks
Sparse Bayesian Neural Networks using Automatic Relevance Determination Variational Dropout provides a Bayesian interpretation of the conventional dropout procedure. Later it was shown that Variational Dropout can be used for model sparsification (Sparse VD), an the effect can be achieved via optimization of variational lower bound wrt individual dropout rates for every weight of the model   In this assignment we would consider another interpretation of this model that uses the Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) prior. This model is described in arXiv:1811.00596.
